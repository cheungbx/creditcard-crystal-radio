creditcard crystal radio
#
This is a crystal radio project for a very tiny crystal radio built on a few unused credit cards.
There is no need to use variable capacity which is hard to fine. We will use a variable inductor or variometer to tune the station.
Refer to this youtube video for more instructions

Print this pattern file to overlay to your credit card to cut it.
